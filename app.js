// The difference between var and let is var allows redeclaration of a variable, but let doesn't allow that. var has global scoping and function scoping, but let includes more than that, includes block scoping. You can hoist variables with var.
// The difference between var and const is var allows redeclaration and reassignment of variables. Similarly, var doesn't have block scoping. You can hoist variables with var.
// The difference between let and const is let allows reassignment of variables.
